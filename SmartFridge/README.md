<b>HOW TO USE V1.0</b><br />
<b>V1.0</b><br />
In the "ADD" page, click "Take Photo" in order to take a new image of your receipt. If you already have an image of your receipt saved, choose "Camera Roll" instead. Then, after about 3 seconds, you will be able to click "Add Item". This will bring you to a new page where you can see the items found in your receipt. In this page, you can swipe left in order to remove any item that is either wrong or you do not wish to include. Once you are done, hit "Confirm" to save the products permanently. You can now tap "View Groceries" to view your permanently stored items. Just tap "Refresh" to update the list.
                             

<b> V2.0 </b><br />
This version of the app, which will be uploaded soon, adds another layer of inventory capacity. This version will include a more powerful algorithm to gather receipt data. It will also combine the FDA food database to give users a more accurate and precise description of their products. The app will also separate the stored items into useful categories.
