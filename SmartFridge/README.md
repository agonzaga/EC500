<b>INSTALLING</b><br />  
Download all zip files from github. The "Smartfridge" zip file contains all of the direct app requirements. The "Pods" zip file includes external requirements such as SwiftyJSON. These two projets must be opened together on Xcode in order to successfully run the app. In order to try the app on your iPhone, you will have to register your phone as a developer phone. Only then will you be able to try it directly. Otherwise, you can use simulators in Xcode. You will not be able to test the "Take Photo" function since you are not using a phone. However, you can select "Camera Roll" and just drag and drop the image of a receipt. all other functionality should be the same in the simulator. 
  
<b>HOW TO USE V1.0</b><br />


<b>V1.0</b><br />
In the "ADD" page, click "Take Photo" in order to take a new image of your receipt. If you already have an image of your receipt saved, choose "Camera Roll" instead. Then, after about 3 seconds, you will be able to click "Add Item". This will bring you to a new page where you can see the items found in your receipt. In this page, you can swipe left in order to remove any item that is either wrong or you do not wish to include. Once you are done, hit "Confirm" to save the products permanently. You can now tap "View Groceries" to view your permanently stored items. Just tap "Refresh" to update the list.
                             

<b> V2.0 </b><br />
This version of the app, which will be uploaded soon, adds another layer of inventory capacity. This version will include a more powerful algorithm to gather receipt data. It will also combine the FDA food database to give users a more accurate and precise description of their products. The app will also separate the stored items into useful categories.
